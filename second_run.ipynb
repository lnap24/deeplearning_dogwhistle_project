This is not about the inclusion of Jews in the values of these nations, then, but about the xenophobic exclusion of an “other”. Invoked in anti-immigration rhetoric with the goal of excluding Muslims, this phrase is actually used to scaffold a false narrative about Christians being persecuted, threatened or besieged, which gives motivation for the protection of “Judeo-Christian values”.

Originating in France as Les Identitaires (\"The Identitarians\"), with its youth wing Generation Identity, the movement expanded to other European countries during the early 21st century. Building on ontological ideas of the German Conservative Revolution, its ideology was formulated from the 1960s onward by essayists such as Alain de Benoist, Dominique Venner, Guillaume Faye and Renaud Camus, who are considered the main ideological sources of the movement.Identitarians promote concepts such as pan-European nationalism, localism, ethnopluralism, remigration, or the Great Replacement, and they are generally opposed to globalisation, multiculturalism, Islamization and extra-European immigration. Influenced by New Right metapolitics, they do not seek direct electoral results, but rather to provoke long-term social transformations and eventually achieve cultural hegemony and popular adhesion to their ideas.",

His “Judeo-Christian values” are about protecting Christmas, and about protecting Christians – at the exclusion of others. “Judeo-Christian” is now most often used to draw a line between imagined Christian values and a perceived (but false) threat of Muslim immigration.Time and again, when Farage and Trump use the term, what they really imply is an “us-versus-them” division between the West and Islam. This is not about the inclusion of Jews in the values of these nations, then, but about the xenophobic exclusion of an “other”. Invoked in anti-immigration rhetoric with the goal of excluding Muslims, this phrase is actually used to scaffold a false narrative about Christians being persecuted, threatened or besieged, which gives motivation for the protection of “Judeo-Christian values”.

This spurred antisemitic beliefs that they were building a secret empire which sought widespread control through financial gains. Given that the Khazars moved into and settled in Eastern Europe, antisemites push the conspiracy that Ashkenzai Jews—Jews descending from Eastern Europe—are not “real Jews” and are working to infiltrate other nations on their quest for world domination (see “not the real Jews”).

         "A noteworthy anti-Semitic theme in 2017 was the use of the term “globalist” as an anti-Semitic slur. Although the term is not inherently anti-Semitic, “globalist” is often used as a pejorative term for people whose interests in international commerce or finance ostensibly make them disloyal to the country in which they live, or who are willing to undermine the financial security of their neighbors in order to benefit transnational interests. Because of the long history of anti-Semitic associations of Jews with money and commerce, and allegations that Jews place their transnational ethnic affiliations ahead of the interests of their non-Jewish neighbors, these pejorative subtexts quickly take on anti-Semitic connotations when the term is applied to individual Jews, groups of Jews, or places where Jews are known to live (i.e. “New York globalists”). Anti-Semites frequently use the term “Globalist” as a code word for Jews.",

         "Boogaloo, boogalo, boog, and big igloo are code words for a rebellion against perceived tyranny, but often used as a cover for (Or misinterpreted as) a race war and the second American Civil War. The term boogaloo is derived from the 1984 movie Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo which is a commonly used phrase online to indicate any sort of sequel, particularly a poor quality one. Big igloo is a derivative synonym that refers to boogaloo  and probably to the \"big tent\" idea of inclusiveness (but for white people since igloos are white), but more likely as a way of evading attempts at moderation. In search of further homophone-ish phrases for their shitposting, this term further morphed into the phrase big luau online, as a reference to the unusually high number of \"Boogaloo Boys\" posting images wearing Hawaiian shirts. This led to a bizarre situation during lockdown protests regarding the 2019-20 COVID-19 outbreak, where many of the far-right extremists that attended showed their devotion to white supremacy by (in reference to the luau) dressing in Hawaiian shirts.",

         "A dog whistle used by TERFs on Tumblr as a replacement for \"cis\", usually in coded phrases like \"hygienic female,\" \"extremely hygienic,\" etc. The implication is that cis women are cleaner than trans women, playing on the stereotype that men have worse personal hygiene than women. TERFs of course view trans women as men. It's also based on a pathologization of transfeminine bottom surgery. TERFs are morbidly fixated on a form of vaginoplasty sometimes used in gender-confirmation surgery. This procedure involves colon tissue grafts, as this allows the vagina to be self-lubricating. TERFs are convinced that all trans women undergo this procedure, and thus that their vaginas must be smelly and gross. It's also been noted that the term \"hygienic\" has an extremely problematic history.",

From the main Wikipedia page for \"identitarianism\":The Identitarian movement or Identitarianism is a pan-European nationalist, far-right political ideology asserting the right of European ethnic groups and white peoples to Western culture and territories claimed to belong exclusively to them. Originating in France as Les Identitaires (\"The Identitarians\"), with its youth wing Generation Identity, the movement expanded to other European countries during the early 21st century. Building on ontological ideas of the German Conservative Revolution, its ideology was formulated from the 1960s onward by essayists such as Alain de Benoist, Dominique Venner, Guillaume Faye and Renaud Camus, who are considered the main ideological sources of the movement.Identitarians promote concepts such as pan-European nationalism, localism, ethnopluralism, remigration, or the Great Replacement, and they are generally opposed to globalisation, multiculturalism, Islamization and extra-European immigration. Influenced by New Right metapolitics, they do not seek direct electoral results, but rather to provoke long-term social transformations and eventually achieve cultural hegemony and popular adhesion to their ideas.",
