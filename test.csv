"This is so cool. It's like, 'would you want your mother to read this??' Really great idea, well done!",0
"Thank you!! This would make my life a lot less anxiety-inducing. Keep it up, and don't let anyone get in your way!",0
This is such an urgent design problem; kudos to you for taking it on. Very impressive!,0
Is this something I'll be able to install on my site? When will you be releasing it?,0
FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU,0
The ranchers seem motivated by mostly by greed; no one should have the right to allow their animals destroy public land.,0
It was a great show. Not a combo I'd of expected to be good together but it was.,0
"Wow, that sounds great.",0
This seems like a step in the right direction.,0
"I agree; I don't want to grant them the legitimacy of protestors. They're greedy, small-minded people who somehow seem to share the mass delusion that this is not only a good idea for themselves as individuals, but is the right thing to do for ranchers at large. Basically: take something that currently belongs to everyone, and give it to a select group of people, so they can profit.",0
Interesting. I'll be curious to see how this works out. I often refrain from commenting because I don't have the time or desire to engage with the couple of resident trolls who seem to jump on every active WW comment thread.,0
Awesome! I love Civil Comments!,0
"I'm glad you're working on this, and I look forward to seeing how it plays out.    The comments sections of online news stories have the potential to be great tools for community interaction about current events, a Neo Town Hall, of sorts.  One of the reasons I rely on Reddit as a platform for news and local discussions is that there's a sense of community interaction that's often lacking in my ""real life,"" hectic discussions.  

But hopefully we won't be tempted to silence those who take unpopular stances.",0
Nice to some attempts to try to make comments better—it feels like any innovation in commenting communities ended with the launch of Disqus nearly a decade ago.,0
"One would hope that the purpose of introducing this system is to encourage more debate and discussion, not less.  It seems there are several things that limit the flow of discussion:  Making comments that are personal attacks or encouraging witch hunts; true spam (which has been a real problem on WW's comment section, in my experience); and chasing rabbits to draw discussions away from the primary subject at hand.

I, for one, don't want to see unpopular opinions silenced.  Healthy debate is an important component of a civil society.  But when discussions degenerate into insults and distraction, it actually limits the ability of people to talk with each other.  I'm believing that this is the intention of your newspaper here, and I hope it's a movement that results in more, not less, commentary on current events.  We need it.",0
"Comments will be randomly chosen and be reviewed by more than one person. But I bet the Civil people have an even better, more thorough answer to this question!",0
She would be a major improvement for city council and she has a long history of giving all citizens a voice. She is a problem solver that is what Portland needs .,0
"I agree! Comments have so much potential to be places for active discussion, especially in publications that already serve an amazing community (but then, I'm biased—I'm a Civil co-founder). We've worked hard to make sure that the comments section won't become an echo chamber, though, by combining clever algorithms on the backend with the peer reviews. That's also why there are two separate questions: ""is this a *good* comment?"" and ""is this comment civil?""",0
"Great question! It's one we're asked a lot. We've designed the system assuming that people *will* try to abuse it. So, in addition to the peer reviews, there are algorithms on the backend doing a lot of meta-analysis. I'm sure the system isn't 100% perfect yet, but we know from months of beta testing that it's a really solid start, and we'll keep working to improve it!",0
"Thanks, Christa!  Will you be adding any features to allow overall ""upvotes"" of the article itself?  Also, notification settings for users?",0
"Our aim is actually the opposite: we want spirited debate in which everyone feels free to participate, without fear of harassment, abuse, or death threats. Right now, a lot of voices are being silenced due to that fear. We designed Civil Comments for civil, respectful discussion and debate—we don't want it to become a ""positive comments only"" echo chamber. There's a lot going on on the backend to prevent abuse of the system. So, everyone is free to speak their mind, even if their opinion is unpopular—so long as they treat each other with respect.",0
"Thanks! We're really going to try — not only to improve civility, but also to make comments more dynamic and interesting.",0
I applaud Civil's efforts to create some new technology in this field. Hoping for more thoughtful discussions moving forward.,0
Why bother writing a review if it's going to be this devoid of content?  I understand that you work for WW. (but that hardly seems like an excuse when Fred Armisen recorded radio voices for Grand Theft Auto IV with the same number of people.),0
"I love the idea of upvoting entire articles, though this would have to be something that the Publisher could turn on and off. We do have a ton of other features currently in the works—following (and blocking!) other users, bookmarking articles during the review process, to read later (I find myself wanting to read the articles that other people are commenting on, as I'm reviewing their comments!), following conversations, and so much more. Thanks for your enthusiasm, Melinda, and your patience! It's a brand-new way to approach comments, and we're going to continue to improve it. We welcome all suggestions and feedback!",0
Troll free since 2016.,0
Awesome!,0
"Not for long!

Commenting for the sake of commenting to rate other comments to better comment on our new comment system.,0
"Interesting concept.

How does Civil Comments plan to monetize their operation?",0
"I already see dozens of ""just commenting to vote on comments to be able to comment"" type of comments.

This voting system is completely insane- you're assuming people have the extra time to *actually read* multiple non related comments?

I would love to see this system installed on oregonlive.com - they have enough online visitors and an established ""troll"" base to really need this service.

With as little online activity as wweek has - it will discourage further growth here.",0
Very cool project!,0
Awesome! Signed up just to give this a shot... good luck to your enterprise!,0
"disqus has way more functionality and obviously a huge following - it can increase visitor count significantly.

disqus also has a moderator feature - a feature that wweek either never wanted to pay their staff to undertake, or never developed a group of people they could trust to do it on their behalf on a volunteer basis.",0
I haven't seen the kind of comments you're mentioning. I'm interested in where this system works and where it's having problems. Do you have a link you could share that has comments like you mentioned?,0
"wmcelha, there are several new and exciting vegan and gluten free options on the new menu!  Buffalo tostones are a fun, vegan, gluten free, soy free option.  Not to mention a killer new veggie burger, vegan tacos, and several nice salads.  Hope to see you there soon!",0
Probably because they consistently waste funds on trendy projects like green bike boxes -- which cost a fortune and have to be repainted every couple of years.  Oy.,0
"The system is set up so if traffic is slow, an algorithm takes over until it picks up.",0
Because the people who drive cars more are the ones who cause more wear and tear on the roads?  Pretty fair and straightforward.,0
"Affordable housing gets built pursuant to tax #3, immediately becomes less affordable pursuant to tax #2.  Brilliant!",0
"Tried this out on another post.  Having to rate three other comments and then my own - is the lead designer a big Foucault fan?  Feels like panopticomments.

I suspect you won't go back, but I prefer Disqus because of the ubiquity and notifications system.",0
"""winning arguments against any member of diversity""

You may have inadvertently given Civil Comments an idea for the 2.0 version of their system.

1. Is this a good comment?

2. Is this comment civil?

3. Did this comment totally just win the argument???",0
"I had a little trouble getting signed up, but after a brief email exchange with the folks at Civil everything appears to be working now.  If they're successful in their goal, I'll be extremely pleased.",0
"Are you taxed as a resident of the state you were in when you bought the ticket, or as a resident of the state you are in when you claim the ticket?

"The letter writing campaign to get livestock off of Malheur Refuge started in the late '70's. The death threat phoned in to Nancy and Denzel's home was in 1979; along with two other friends I was hired a bodyguard to help protect N&D that weekend. The Hammond's ejection of the Ferguson's from the Diamond Dance was the year or two before the death threat. Great article WW and Jim D. For the last 10 days, lots of us have been wishing we could hear Denzel make witty quips about the Bundycon's occupation of the refuge hq. Sacred Cows at the public trough is easy to get on Amazon. Read and learn, read and learn ... great history of western livestock abuses ...",0
"I've been loosely following Civil Comments since it was announced late last year; I even tried a beta demonstration. One thing I've been wondering is: will users will have to sign up for new profiles on any site that uses Civil, or do you have one Civil profile that you'd use on any partner site?",0
My sign-up just now couldn't have been smoother!,0
"Thanks so much for following our progress and helping to test the software, David! To answer your question: you'll have one over-arching Civil account where you can manage different profiles for different sites. Of course, you're welcome to use the same information across all sites! We decided that it'd be best to be able to present yourself differently to different communities, though. I might, for example, want to be portland_hipster15 here on Willamette Week, but prefer to be MrWhiskers on Cat Enthusiast Digest!",0
"Enterprise licenses are available now, and we'll have tiered small business plans available very soon! We will also have a free, public version out later this year.",0
"This was completely fascinating. But it left me with a question I haven't seen reported elsewhere either: These guys identify as ranchers, so who are their customers? What are the economics of their situation -- are they in the same situation as chicken farmers, where they have had their livelihoods squeezed away ... I'd like to understand what drives someone who seems to have so much to be so alienated, and their economic situation must play into that.",0
"Thanks so much for your input, and for giving us a chance! We do have user following (and blocking!) as well as more notifications in the works for future versions. I hope you'll stick around and let us know what you think!
And yes, the software architect, Aja, is a Foucault fan.",0
I think you left out one very important organization who help the mentally ill over 18. NAMI Multnomah. They help people with mental distress find within or without NAMI to find them the services that can be most beneficial to them.  I am a volunteer for NAMI Multnomah in their Connection program. It is a walk-in group to people 18 and up. No matter the diagnosis we welcome them and help them learn new coping skills and develop tools to further  help them learn to cope from week to week. We have groups all over Multnomah County. By going  to http://nami.multnomah.org/. You will with out much difficulty find the list of Connection Groups and their times and locations.,0
"Thanks for the info! One other thing I just noticed: in the email I got about your reply, the link to view it didn't work (at least not from Mail.app on OS X). Looks like it came through as x-webdoc:// and probably doesn't know how to deal with that scheme.

Really love what you're doing with Civil Comments, though! Can't wait to see it on more sites. Might even bring back comments on my personal site once it's available!",0
Interesting idea. I tend to use content blockers on sites that I know don't moderate comments very well. If they adopted a system like this I might stop doing that.,0
This was quite a comprehensive list. Goody for the writers and the people that researched for this guide.,0
"Ryan Bundy seems like a nice, responsible  human being who has been sold a bill of goods by his  intellectually domineering brother, who he idolizes. Ammon has a bunch of other similarly situated nutters following him as well.  Where? No one quite knows. And, unless you live in Burns no one cares. Personally, I am glad these bearded, cammo wearing, narrowly educated , nuisances....are there and not here. Traffic is bad enough.  No reason to make it worse with a Constitutional Pagent Play in the Federal Building in downtown PDX.  And,  repulsive as their  cammo costumes are ( all available at Cabela's and Andy and Bax) with their brandishing weapons it's a very immature male form of exhibitionism....cowboys and indians for middle aged men.",0
"All the framed boxes must take up extra code and bandwidth usage to send all the extra code to our browsers..

Then there is all the ""2 more replies"" buttons to click on - that is amazingly annoying - I don't want to have to click on half a dozen ""more replies"" buttons to see what is being said.

And really, you have to vote on 3 other replies? What percentage of your users wait more than 1/2 second before randomly clicking on a response? Oh well, I digress.",0
"Ah, so part of the ""back end"" and ""algorithms"" - automatic comment rejection if you don't vote on the 3 random comments in a way that is conforming enough to the way other users vote - or if you vote too fast, as I assumed many would do - just clicking a random button too quickly means that you're unwilling to ""participate"" - you just want to ""comment"" which doesn't ensure a ""civil"" community of commenters :

"I think Wweek is in a strange spot with that.  Their comments can be active, but they're nowhere near as busy as say, OregonLive.  Forcing the writers or other staff to monitor comments might be overkill.

I definitely get a newspaper not wanting outsiders handling that, for fear of confusion and accusations of bias.  It seems like every OregonLive comment thread has accusations of bias due to deleted posts despite repeated insistence that comment moderation is not handled in-house.

I've also seen several communities where conforming to the political view is more of a metric for desirability than anything to do with tone or actual content, and mods reinforced that.  The results of volunteers may....vary, to be polite.",0

"Hopefully there will be enough commenters who are honestly here to have a civil discussion to allow civil comments that challenge conventional wisdom. The posts that challenge conventional wisdom yet aren't civil won't hit the thread, and, sure, some folks will always try and scam the system by not allowing comments that they disagree with thru, but I wouldn't be surprised if many of the folks that take that approach when reviewing comments are the same ones who are having comments denied for being uncivil.  If that's the case it may be somewhat of a self-correcting problem, where they become bored with not having any comments post and go elsewhere.  I'm just speculating however only time will tell. I also would not be surprised if I was totally off base on all of this.",0
"If it is effective in slowing us down in order to reflect upon how we engage with others and draws attention to the humanity of each recipient, then I approve.",0
"Hi David, we did consider all of these possibilities when building our system! In fact, we assume people will try to game it; that's why we have a lot going on behind the scenes algorithmically. The commenter-facing part of the app is very straightforward, but there are a lot of checks and balances on the backend to prevent coordinated attacks and also to keep comments sections from becoming echo chambers. Banning insulting words isn't enough, unfortunately; people will always be smarter than word filters, even if the algorithm tries to take context into account. We do have a backup algorithm for low-volume situations that basically does this (plus a few other things), but it's not as effective as human reviewers.

I hear you on the ""more replies"" button; I don't think we'll remove it entirely, but I agree it's appearing too often, after too few comments. We'll be pushing updates very soon!",0

"I'm not sure I see it the same way.  The minimum wage was designed to be a living wage; a living wage in Portland is substantially higher than it is in, say, John Day or even Bend.  

I think this could be characterized as understanding that businesses in rural Oregon shouldn't have to pay their employees enough to live in Portland when, in fact, they don't.",0
I'm doing the same thing! :),0
"Getting rid of a way to truncate long reply threads seems like it might cause other problems. For example, if folks are sorting the comments by what's most popular (which is a handy feature) and there isn't a way to truncate the replies, everyone who replies to the top-most comment has their post appear above everyone else who simply posts to the main thread. Something like this: 

1. I'm the most popular comment! 
     a. response
     b. response
     c. response
     d. response
     e. response
     f. response
     g. response
     h. response
     i. response
     J. response
2. I'm the second most popular comment.  
     a. response
     b. response
     c. response

Imagining a scenario where the most popular comment has 200 responses on it, this could be a real pain. 

Perhaps seeing the four most popular responses to each comment could be done? I'm not sure.",0

Maybe they should have their own institution specific to their own problems.,0
"They were talented, but neither would have had access to art school without government funding. Giving low-income kids priority doesn't limit other kids, who have plenty of enrichment opportunities (including the same government-funded ones!)

"While I was initially conflicted upon hearing this, the more I think about it the more I feel that having two separate min. wages isn't a good idea.

Personal attacks, harassment, and death threats only silence people—either through fear or by forcing sites to turn off their comments entirely.

Well, LaVoy Finicum just had his foster children taken from his ranch, likely as a result of him becoming a militant criminal likely to face a suite of federal felony charges. Some reports and tax filings from his home state suggest Finicum was receiving, some years, $100,000 from Catholic Charities to provide foster care. While - according to his statements to the media - his cows barely pay for ranch expenses, the money from the kids could presumably pay for his lifestyle (surely other state money also helped). Was he getting free labor from boys who could work with him on his ranch? Perhaps, but all we know is that with the loss of his foster kids, Finicum is sad to be losing his monetary income, and says he may have to go back to eating rice and beans now that he's not getting paid thousands a week to house, feed, and provide ample ranch work for foster kids.",0
"Am I missing something, because there's nothing about the ""free-range, organic, cruelty-free"" section that appeared to be joking, or have any self-deprecating self-awareness, which is what this whole deal hinges on. Are there any commenters who are going to call the supervisor on this obvious distortion? 

I think this email-leaking parent did exactly the right thing. If a teacher has been assigning something like this for 20 years, there's no point in ""confronting her directly"". If her supervisor comes up with the line that defends her free-range, earth-friendly snobbery was ""a joke"", there's no reason to talk to anyone at the school about this assignment (clearly the entire administration sees the mind-numbing cognitive dissonance in labeling a cake full of sugar ""earth friendly"" and ""cruelty free""). Leak it to the WW, and see what happens: Lo and behold, suddenly the creativity-loving food snob changes her tune.

There's nothing wrong with advocating for creativity (though I personally am skeptical of elementary school creativity proselytizers). There's absolutely nothing wrong with using and advocating ""earth friendly"" and ""human healthy"" ingredients.  But a middle school teacher - even one who lives in Portland - has no credentials to know what these ingredients are, and no right to push parents of her students to make financial lifestyle decisions based on the teacher's personal moral stance on branding and labeling of chicken and wheat products. In any case, she's recommending they make cakes out of cookie or brownie or cake batters. The number 1 or 2 ingredient is going to be some form of sugar, which is probably the worst thing you could eat, health-wise, and ""plantation-consciousness""-wise, anyway.",0

"This comment system is so crappy you can't cut and paste a reasonable sized document, so here goes in multiple posts the actual ballot measure as voted on.  Nowhere will you find an elephant reserve listed. There is no breach of contracts

QUESTION: Shall Zoo protect animal health and safety; conserve, recycle water; issue $125 million in general obligation bonds; require independent audits?

If the bonds are approved, they will be payable from taxes on property or property ownership that are not subject to the limits of Sections 11 and 11b, Article XI of the Oregon Constitution.

SUMMARY: Measure will:
Provide more humane care for animals: update four outdated and undersized enclosures with larger, more natural and safer spaces

Protect animal health and safety: modernize Zoo's substandard 45 year old animal clinic determined deficient by the American Zoo Association.",0
"Part 2 of the actual ballot measure.

Increase access to conservation education: provide more space for summer camps, classes and hands-on learning for kids, adults, and families.

Improve water quality: replace the Zoo's 1950's sewer system, reducing pollution by separating sewage from storm water, harvesting runoff for reuse.

Conserve, reuse water: install water recycling filtration systems; replace leaking, worn-out plumbing, irrigation systems, saving 11,000,000 gallons of water annually.

Improvements will meet sustainability standards.

Condors
Provide an on-site Condor exhibit.

Protect Animal Health & Safety

"I wasn't living in Portland in 2008, but have seen the taped statement of Metro councilmember Collette assuring an audience, prior to the vote, that an off-site preserve for the elephants would definitely be included in the zoo bond.

"Part 5 of ballot measure

Save Water, Reduce Water Pollution, Improve Water Quality
Since most of the zoo's pipes, plumbing and irrigation systems also date back to the 1950s and '60s, many are outdated, leaking and well past their useful lives. The most expensive utility cost at the 55-acre zoo is water, and leaking pipes, run-off, inadequate filtration systems, and lack of water storage all contribute to wasting water and increasing costs. Replacing the sewer system and separating sewage from storm water will reduce pollution, improve water quality and save costs. Adding modern water filtration and recycling systems to the hippo and penguin pools will save over 11,000,000 gallons of water every year.

That's all the relevant parts of the ballot measure. No mention of an elephant reserve. That's what was voted on.

Instead, they are mostly not showing up to the comprehensive plan hearings at all. Density, as Angus Duncan of the state climate change commission points out, is key to climate policy. If 7,00 people live within walking distance of each other, a grocery store will spring up to serve them that they can walk to, rather than drive. Density is critical to the viability of transit; the reason the New York subway system is economically viable is that there are a lot of people per stop. I think it's important for people who care about the climate to explain that to their fellow citizens.

"Predatory patrol towing isn't a big subject, and there is no advocacy group that is paying any attention to it, but the City of Portland has completely backed off of enforcing state law where the towing predators are operating on private property, and this is Commissioner Novick's failure. He's in charge of towing.

The City has allowed Retriever Towing to operate in open violation of ADA for years at their NW Quimby lot, and there is absolutely no provision in city ordinance that takes into account when they tow a mobility-disabled person's vehicle.  Wheelchair or no wheelchair, the person has to get themselves to the tow yard (which does not have wheelchair access).

Led by Senator Avel Gordly, the legislature enacted important new citizen protections against predatory towing effective January 1, 2008, but there is no effective way for Portlanders to learn what their rights are other than what the predatory towers themselves tell you. A description of the protections has never appeared on the City website. The version posted there has never been correct.

It is only in the past two years the the City began enforcing the signage requirements, and the City Towing Coordinator worked with the towers to pass the costs onto the citizens. $ 20 of every tow bill goes to the towers to ""compensate"" them for their signs, with no upper limit, and your $ 20 is likely to be paying for signs completely unrelated to the place your vehicle was towed from.

Portland towers are allowed to operate in open violation of state law and the City's own statutes, providing towing services to property owners for free. That is specifically prohibited by state law and City ordinance.

Senator Gordly's legislation was intended to protect people living in apartment complexes, generally low-income, minority populations, and they have no one standing up for them in City Hall. I hope you are that champion.",0
"An elephant in a zoo is an animal exhibition in a sterile, unnatural environment. Artificial breeding is not natural. It is a tortuous procedure as tubes for insemination are forced up the female's reproductive tract. Elephants in zoos are prone to TB, hepatitis, joint and foot problems, and early deaths, not to mention boredom and depression of constricted movement.  
In contrast, larger tracts of land in sanctuary allow elephants a more natural life.  It's a holistic approach to what the elephants need.  They are more apt to flourish and show off their gentle and playful personalities.  Visitors see an elephant more similar to those in the wild.  In sanctuary, it's a win-win for elephants and patrons alike!

How can the author claim that Star Wars is better when he hasn’t even seen Star Trek?!,0
"Ok, first of all, Star Trek came out before Star Wars. Two: Star Trek has vastly superior ships (shields, phasers, photon toroedeos) all much more powerful then the Star Wars destroyer. Not to mention the destroyer misses 29 out of 23 shots at close range when the ship is making no effort to maneuver from them. Star Trek ships also can reach higher speeds and go up to 9 times the speed of light. 

Fights between the Republic and the Empire are complete junk as the Republic is always outgunned like 30 to 1 but still win. Star Trek also features a variety of episodes instead of always focusing on just poorly shooting each other. Not to mention the ""superior"" AT walker which not tripped by thin wires and the Death Star which had a huge tunnel to the reactor. 

I don't see how anything of Star Wars is better (besides the aliens) then Star Trek. It's simple: if Star Trek and Star Wars fought a battle Star Trek would win.",0
"Here to (tongue-in-cheek) refute you:
1. History:  Star Trek is much older. The original series was 1966-67.
2. Way off! The original space opera is Captain Video.

4. The big questions: Hey, Yoda is kinda small!

They are apples and oranges. Neither has to be better than the other. Both have their great qualities. Star Wars = Epic. Star Trek = Parable.,0

If you go way back to  the original Star Trek show, dated 2009, it was the first show to introduce this technique.

"I always find the Star Wars/Star Trek debate funny because they seem so different to me that I have a hard time understanding how the two can be compared. Star Trek was created as a series of books and an episodic TV show, meaning that it was meant to have discreet stories told and wrapped up in a short time. Star Wars, on the other hand, was written as a series of movies with a far-reaching storyline. Star Trek is meant to be set in our own future, complete with our history and built upon our understanding of the real universe. Star Wars, however, exists ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."" That opens SW up to potentially involve elements that would be too fantastical in a universe based on our own, no matter how futuristic. There are many other reasons, but fundamentally, comparing SW and ST does not seem like an appropriate comparison. (Also, if you insist on comparing them, it would probably be best to be done by someone with a reasonable degree of knowledge of both properties.)",0

"I'm not a big fan of either, but I've seen both, if you can count the first three Star Wars movies and a random smattering of different Star Trek episodes as having seen them. 

Of course you have an apples and oranges problem in making the comparison, because the scope of the two projects – objectives, budgets, people involved, and all things creative – were so different. Trek was conceived to sell ads on network TV, right? Wars was a Lucas/Spielburg extravaganza. Sure, Trek became a series of movies too, but that was afterthought. So it bothers me that you cite history based on the movies with Star Wars first, when Star Trek actually started almost two decades earlier than Star Wars, in 1966, as a television show. 

Production values, star power, effects, of course all go to Star Wars, and there is budget and objectives behind that. But Star Trek did start earlier, paved the way, and had a long history of different people involved, with an interesting flair for putting real human problems (racism, for example, a recurring theme in Star Trek as the different races dealt with each other) into a new perspective. And there's interesting comparisons on the big picture, too ... the great Yoda perspective and quotes, of course, and the whole power of the force, in Star Wars. But Trek embraced big picture too, like the larger collective metaphor of Seven of Nine. 

I wish you'd done a straight compare and contrast, instead of which is better. Better will always be subjective, and it's too close ended, in my opinion.",0

Kinda.  But there's more to the story: it is a city run by real estate interests where rules are not enforced, where the city refuses to control AirBnB and allows Vacasa to flout the tax laws.  It is tax compression in the inner Eastside.
It is tax breaks and grants thrown at real estate investors.  It's out of state money buying apartments and upping the rent to cover the costs associated with flipping apartment buildings.

This just proves that we cannot trust our government to tell the truth. But we still need to hold them accountable for their statements to the public.  And since there was so much public outcry about the preserve, Metro did option land, did hold hearings to discuss the plans for the preserve and did target in 2008 $12 million for captital expenses and a feasibility study.

"In the interest of understanding each other, I will include my comments as they were written for this article.

Hi Rachel,

In brief, I have quite a few concerns about the Commissioner's approach, namely that pursuing density without adequate protections in place to prevent displacement and invest in community stability for existing residents (in particular low-income renters, communities of color) puts us on the wrong path to being the next San Francisco where hardly anyone of modest income can afford to live. Our governments and the market have thus far failed to stem displacement in our rapidly gentrifying city, and we continue to lack the tools necessary to increase density in a way that accounts for displacement. I fear that the city of Portland will finally achieve a ""sustainable, equitable"" city, but only once the vast majority of low-income residents and communities of color are pushed outside the city limits. <continued in next comment.",0
"To my knowledge, the commissioner has yet to endorse Anti-Displacement PDX's 28 measures in the Comprehensive Plan. This is a crucial first step--but still just a first step--in giving the city the tools and underlying mandates necessary to better confront the problem. There's a long way to go in removing state-level pre-emptions on rent control, inclusionary zoning, and the minimum wage--all things that impact the ability of people to afford living in the city. 

I am happy to talk more about this today over the phone, but would also be happy to field questions over email if that's easier.

All the best,

Adam",0
"I worry that pursuing density in the current market may be condemning us to repeat the same eco-apartheid we're already seeing--that's worsening--in inner Portland neighborhoods where sustainable, walkable, green neighborhoods are available exclusively to wealthier residents who can afford it. 

From Rachel: ""Could you tell me what you think of that criticism from him -- that the local environmentalists aren't mobilizing on what's an important issue that would actually have an important impact locally?""

Me:
""I don't think that there is a consensus among local environmental groups about exactly how we should be increasing density. A lot of these neighbors who are dominating the comp plan hearings are complaining about the loss of mature trees, solar access, and the general character of their neighborhoods. I think a lot of environmentalists see density development driven by a market frenzy as sometimes inherently in contradiction with some environmental values. <continued>",0
"""...I think that others understand that while density may require sacrifice, that it's a necessary direction to go. 

It's one thing if the density is resulting in more sustainable livable communities, but we are not exactly evaluating these developments and this growth on both sides of the ledger--including in particular metrics for displacement. We aren't requiring that enough social good be done. And when we try to incentivize social good instead of require it, it is comes in measures far too inadequate to do much to solve the problems we're facing. Many people in the grassroots understands that density is a radically transformational force in neighborhoods--and one that is controversial in both legitimate ways and in NIMBYist ways. I don't think the issue is as black and white as the city thinks it is and that's why environmentalists haven't been galvanized by Commissioner Novick's comments. <continued>",0
"No, he wants to increase the health of our children's teeth.",0
"Beyond that, the Comp Plan is a massive and complex document with interconnected issues and policies that many folks have trouble fully understanding what it all means and how it might affect them. The meetings are usually quite dry, require large investments in terms of hours with no guarantee of a slot to speak. And each hearing covers a wide range of issues. It's not the kind of process that makes it easy to organize around policies, rouse the public, and find a way to speak in a unified voice--especially in a way that elevates the voices of those most vulnerable to displacement, climate change, and other major challenges like lack of adequate transportation access. 350PDX has promoted the Comp Plan hearings and has sent people there to speak, though at a certain point it becomes hard to distinguish anyone from such a large crowd with differing interests. <continued>",0

"Yes, public transportation services Like Uber and Lift, now subject to the City's regulatory code, should be held to the same standards that every other public transportation provider is held to.  

Taxis have an unfunded mandate from the City requiring them to have wheelchair accessible vehicles in at least 10% of their fleet.  They can only charge the same rates as regular cabs.  This results in the taxi companies subsidizing them, while at the same time trying to remain competitive with a huge multi-national corporation that does not share that mandate.

While this denial of service to wheelchair-bound users is probably the most egregious of Novick's concessions to Uber (although I would argue that a close second is surely the Non-Disclosure Agreement they signed) there are many others, such as requiring smart phones and credit cards.   This disproportionately affects the elderly and low-income.  Too bad they don't have lobbyists, Uber has 10.",0

"Qtip: Quit Taking It Personally

Understand why someone is upset - identify the behavior - be an example

Passions are high - media and politicians take advantage.

Bernie Sanders attracts passionate participation from people who have been outside the political process and he attracts independents, some republicans and many disillusioned liberals, democrats.

It is extremely frustrating to hear people say 'life's not fair' and government as we have known it, we need to build upon it, when social and economic inequality points to a more dramatic redirection of our national attention, money and time.

If it is nasty to state my truth that HRC stands for, supports and is supported by much of what seems wrong with Washington DC, then, I too am 'nasty'.

"Part 1 of 2 due to WW's cruddy comment system:

Home ownership certainly can bring wealth accumulation, but have you thought about why?  I think the answer is racism, exclusion, and inequity.

A brief history of American homeownership:  racial zoning codes, race covenants, explicitly discriminatory practices by government agencies like FHA, HOLC, explicitly discriminatory practices by realtors, covert discrimination by lenders and other players in the real estate industry, and, when all of those other defenses failed, racial violence and intimidation by regular citizens.  We can add to that the wildly inequitable mortgage interest deduction, by which homeowners benefit from government largesse far more than renters do, and of course Oregon's own particularly bizarre property tax system.",0

As you say, owning a home gives a chance of wealth accumulation, it is no sure thing.  Homes can also drop in value, which makes their support such a big concern for homeowners.

The resolution  called for capital expenses of $12 million to be set aside for a possible offsite preserve. The onsite exhibit was budgeted at $19 million, now skyrocketed to $59 milllion. The voters did not approve $59 million for an onsite exhibit and after a disastrous 2009 audit in which Metro was criticized for mismanaging bond monies, Metro came up with this grossly inflated figure and a ""master plan"" that was created after the vote.",0

Nonsense.  The NY Times had been writing slobbery articles about Portland, whether for the Travel section, or about progressive urban planning/quality of life, for years before Portlandia came on the air.  

There has always been an influx, but the acceleration began in the early 2000s, which tracked with the nationwide trend of younger people as well as middle-aged urban professionals moving back into the city core in pretty much every major, desirable city in the country.  You don't think the same thing hasn't happened in NYC, LA, SF, etc.?  Portland is not unique in terms of rising rents, gentrification, the city center getting more crowded and competitive, etc.  And it's definitely not unique in the fact that its character is changing - that also happens with every other city.

Politics is no longer about unwavering loyalty to The Party, and absolute, unquestioning support of The One favorite within that party.

It can be quite an adjustment to accept that no one is required to support a candidate just because of party affiliation.

After that housing and street repair policy and everything else are on the same level and must compete for attention and funding. Below all of that is ""growing responsible businesses.""

(So, he definitely deserves a break, but it's real loss to maintaining an enlightened citizenry, especially against the evil forces of media consolidation and Lars Larson.) CITM had weekly interviews with my Congressman Peter DeFazio, Oregon's Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian, and Oregon journalists from ""Street Roots,"" ""The Skanner,"" ""Portland Mercury,"" and ""Willamette Week."" Then, there were timely interviews with Penny Okamoto of Ceasefire Oregon and Michele Stranger Hunter of NARAL Oregon. Lastly, the daily history segment gave vital perspectives and Wolfson's sage presence beckoned to Cronkite or Ellerbee.",0

"I've worked in public contracting for over a decade, as a contract manager for m employer, and as a community partner with it other  jurisdictions including Portland and Multnomah County. I have been dismayed, pretty much every time I've participated in Portland and Multnomah County, to find how they consistently fail to comply with state public bidding rules. My experience is that they know who they want to give the money to and they do with little to no fair access, they rarely articulate measurable outcomes, rarely monitor contracts t be sure taxpayers money is well spent, and almost never introduce consequences when contractors fail to perform. I often hear from people/businesses who would like to contract with the city or county who feel completely shut out of the process.",0
"Betsy Johnson is the last of the true independents - the closest thing we've had in Oregon politics since Sen. Wayne Morse.

"I have to disagree on this one!  I have 3 pairs and would like more for every day of my cycle. I have a grotesquely heavy period.  I am able to wear these most days without a backup, and I am not weirdly damp down there.  Tampons and pads give me infections, and the cup doesn't work for my weirdly shaped cervix.  This has been a LIFE SAVER for me because I ALWAYS LEAKED from tampons and pads and now I don't. This means being able to leave the house during my period! This was an issue before due to the leaking. My sister has the same deal. So this is great for some women. If you have a heavy period and a leaking problem, I highly recommend these!",0
I must have missed every one of Hartmann's vitriolic moments.  The idea seems quite strange to me.,0

"Is this Foundation under the All Hand's Raised umbrella?  If so this will have a negative impact on the equity grants.  A third of the dollars raised by schools (after the first 10,000) are placed in the Equity Fund for the schools that don’t have the same fundraising power.",0
"...for example, in the article Jack posted, it's legal when the officer is unlawfully entering your home, not simply when ""your life is in jeopardy"" and not simply when the cop is ""unlawfully trying to arrest you"" (to quote the original article).

When that happens and the feds win, you don't want to be in America.  When that happens America is no longer a free country.",0
"These are not terrorists.  They are people like you and me trying to make ends meet in a bad economy.  They don't live in the cities so they are used to being the law in their jurisdiction.  The Feds have to follow the law, if they don't this will spark a civil war because common law and the constitution are the foundation of laws in America.  Without these foundations, even statute law loses it's standing.",0

"Dance Teacher Magazine did a ""Teachers' Tools"" profile of Gina Candland in their September print issue, and it was published on dance-teacher.com in December. I emailed the editors to inform them about the Moxie scandal, and they removed the article from the web.

"Enid, while I appreciate that you are not intending to harm, unfortunately, WW has inflicted harm. By writing ""Moxie pinned the fallout on"" and removing all the comments on the other article, you imply fault and make the legal process more difficult. Additionally, the auto reply set up by Moxie was Slander/Libel. By reprinting without clarification, WW has a hand in spreading false information. Attaching this to this new company also can perceivably hurt their budding reputation. Given this, our attorney has advised that we not conduct an interview concerning the specifics of our case (we are suing for fraud and damages) until the court process is completed. We will contact you with the verdict (we've been told the process will take 6-9 months). Has anyone reached out to Mrs. Patel?

"""It’s actually a grave injustice to all the people who want to live in a sustainable Portland but are basically being told they don’t deserve to because they don’t make enough money.""

But who has the human right to housing in Portland?  Only the people who were born and grew up here?  The people who happen to be here now when whatever law(s) you have in mind get(s) passed?  What about the people who would like to move to Portland in the future because they see opportunity here?  

There has to be some kind of sorting mechanism, and if it's not the open market, then what metric do you use that is more fair across the board?  There will always be a limited housing supply in Portland relative to the would-be population, so you will always be excluding somebody, even with the Community Land Trust model.  How do you choose who gets the Community Land Trust housing and still be fair?  A lottery system?",0
"""the wrong path to being the next San Francisco""

But San Francisco has had rent control for years, yet this is the same policy people are advocating.  If you don't want to become the next San Francisco, why on earth would you rely on the same policies that turned San Francisco into what it is today?

What San Francisco has in spades is an anti-development zoning code and general mentality, which prevents new housing (including affordable housing) from being built.

Inclusionary zoning combined with easing zoning restrictions (e.g., parking requirements) for certain types of residential construction could go a long way towards increasing affordable housing *and* creating the density/walkability that promotes sustainable living practices, and is the best place to start at this point in Portland's transformation.

Starting with rent control and anti-displacement measures will just get you to San Francisco status sooner.",0
"""Are law enforcement not servants of the people?"" 

Yes, with the understanding that 'the people' doesn't mean 'folks who want to use land however they see fit, regardless of the consequences.' In other words, 'the people' here means the folks who want to have and enjoy wildlife sanctuaries, and who abide by the laws that create such places. 

""Was the government not created to remain the same as it was made?"" 

Er, no? I suspect I'm missing some context here, but the government has evolved over time and (I think) largely by design. The last amendment to the US constitution was ratified in 1992. Legislative bodies revise laws all the time.  Our nation's founders didn't foresee wiretapping and little Sally having a Bouncing Betty for show-and-tell and so forth, so the government adapts to handle things. Sometimes it adapts well, sometimes not-so-well. It wasn't created to remain immutable, though.",0

The majority of Portlanders like SFH, hence Novick's abysmal approval ratings.

"Dear Willamette Weak,
I am writing in regards to your recent article concerning the Northwest Academy. As a student, I would like to point out numerous factual errors in your article. First of all, I respect every students’ and parents’ right to disagree with the decision that was made. However, I would like to point that 1) the student in question, with the hit list, was seen by a professional who deals with troubled adolescents. They stated to the school that he did not pose any threat to himself or other students. The student also maintains that the list was a joke, and that the individuals on it were students from a previous school. As admittedly inappropriate as it was, it is irresponsible to imply the school ignored a threat to any student’s safety. 2) The implication that because this is a 20K tuition school it should not provide students with a second chance or hold them under more social scrutiny than any other institution is absurd.",0
"(Part Two)
It is expensive because it provides a higher academic education in an arts based environment that is not offered elsewhere, not because we have an inherently better-than-public-school student body. Teenagers are teenagers, and as we do pride ourselves on having students with exceptional and advanced maturity, our job as a school is to encourage that, and TEACH them to have that, not mandate every student come in with it. Third of all, and most importantly, the insinuation that Mrs. Folberg’s retirement has anything to with issue is reckless, and I question your journalistic integrity by publishing that article that led the public to such blatantly incorrect ideas. Mary is an amazing head of school; we all love her. But, she has been thinking of retiring for a while, and only recently announced it.",0

She has built this school to the amazing place it is, and tainting her legacy is deplorable. Mary Vinton Folberg deserves to be celebrated for the world-class educator she is, nothing less.

Thanks to a generous scholarship my daughter is able to attend the school. Mental health problems exist across all spectrums of our society. NW Academy is no exception. 

Prior to attending NW Academy last year my daughter attended public school.  While not all aspects of her previous school were bad crime, bullying, huge class sizes, poor quality of education, unengaged parents and teachers, intolerance, little exposure to performing arts, were just a few of my reasons for moving her to NW Academy.

"I echo christa_m's remark below - I am most interested in the answer to #7. With due respect to Mr. Jaquiss, I am perplexed about the placement of this item so far down the list. I also can't fathom these individuals as ""protesters"" - that describes peaceful marchers objecting to violent deaths at the hands of police officers, not an armed militia. 

These armed domestic terrorists were allowed to overtake control of land protected by our national government for the safety of our wildlife without consequence for 3 weeks; a number of them still remain unfettered in their unlawful, threatening behavior. While in no way do I wish official intervention had led to any loss of life, I most assuredly have far more concern for their being held accountable than I do for the details of their arrest. Is it not obvious why they'd be transferred to Portland? Does it matter if they were drawn away from the refuge under false pretense? I do not understand the tone or intention of this piece.",0

Other than ticket sales, venues in Portland have limited steams of income. A bar is a way to support the immense cost it takes to throw an event. Maria opted to go with marijuana when the olcc created huge obstacles for her to succeed in keeping the doors open. She has offered complimentary times where the alcohol has been free to still serve the community in needs of a ""nightclub atmosphere."" And the olcc is still fighting her.

Because the OLCC hasn’t figured out a way to profit from cannabis in the same way it has from its Prohibition-era monopoly of state liquor sales it will continue use these tactics to control our private conduct. 

What’s the answer? City commissioners, state representatives and business alliances should meet with current and past venue owners in their districts to hear about their experiences with the OLCC. What’s learned should be shared publicly. Using the findings, the groups should work together to come up with a code of conduct for the OLCC and solutions that work for both safety and business.

The Olcc allegations are false. Toth never stated the art opening would not have alcohol for the Gremlins event. We planned for it the entire time w Copa wine as a sponsor. This is Olcc kicking up dirt, there was nothing in violation. The suggested donation box was a question for the inspectors when they arrived. They prohibited this so it was not used.

As for the ""8 missed classes"" policy, it sounds like that's based on absenteeism rather than a suspension.  But I think if my child had emotional or academic struggles, I'd be overjoyed to have his case looked at independently of policy.  All situations are different, and no one size fits all.

"A brief history to provide some perspective:
McCormick Pier was the first substantial project leading to the conversion of the industrial area north of Burnside, resulting in the creation of what is now called The Pearl District. It is the root of The Pearl’s trunk.
In 1979, the Bill Naito Co. acquired the property from Union Pacific. Bill Naito was widely recognized for taking on ventures that were at least as beneficial to the community as they were potentially moneymaking. In 1981 he built the 300-unit McCormick Pier Apartments along the waterfront, replacing a derelict warehouse district and providing needed middle-income housing in an area where other developers had concluded it could not succeed.
The company sold the property in 2002 to a developer who successfully converted the apartments into condominiums. 
Naito Parkway is named for a responsible developer who had a great influence on Portland’s growth into a unique and desirable city.

"Major High Five to Maria Toth!

Refuge should be able to rent to whomever it wants to and offer whatever beverages or plants or plant extracts that it wants.  Adults should be able to consume whatever they want to behind closed doors when they consent by free will.  

Alcohol is an intoxicant, and the OLCC treats it like a vice and a commodity.  

Cannabis is an entheogen and a vitamin and food.  The OLCC has literally no jurisdiction to mandate that a simple plant can't be consumed along side alcohol.  Assuming adults don't operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated, they harm nothing by enjoying any range of substances.  

Lets all remember when religious institutions gained certificates that allowed them to use alcoholic wine for sacrament during prohibition.  Lets all remember that entheogens were/are the original sacrament.  

Moralism is a slippery slope and dictating what adults should and shouldn't do with their bodies within private dwellings is not American.

The government of the United States, in all its branches, has known of this use, has never forbidden it, nor taken any steps to arrest it.

First of all, Buford v. Houtz was an easement case dealing with sheep trampling over private land on the way to graze on public land.

Second, the quote above is conditional.  If a land is not left open and unenclosed, or if a government action forbids a particular use, then the land is no longer free.  Multiple acts have been passed since 1890, most importantly the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, that regulate grazing on public lands and requires ranchers to pay a fee for those rights.

That means that the public can use it only during designated times of day, only for certain purposes, and only the path itself is open to the public. There are certain circumstances that allow the HOA to close the path, for instance it is allowed for maintenance and/or repair.  Please, let's move on to solutions to the real problems here. In the time it took you to post the same comment repeatedly, you could have done proper research. The HOA closed the path because that area has gotten way out of control, and a sense of lawlessness has taken over. There have been muggings, stabbings, rampant theft, public deification, littering and drug abuse. What would you propose to do about that?",0

"At the end of the day we really need both. The only units being constructed in the central city are ""luxury units"" which are the same as normal units but with a more decorated lobby for an extra 20%.

And thats cool, but you shouldnt format it as rankings when you clearly are not an expert on the subject (seriously dude, the 8s? as the best ever?  you trolling?)

"From a previous buyout in WW on this developer's history:

""His company is known for building relatively inexpensive apartments without a lot of parking.

It feels like a bicycle-themed Comfort Inn.""

His son already announced that the Soros Foundation efforts in the EU are ending.

I would much prefer a proportional electoral college because the EC as it stands tells republicans in CA and democrats in TX it’s best to not waste your time voting for president these days.

I’m genuinely starting to believe that the divide between left and right amongst males is simply about testosterone levels.

Immigation is awful. It helps billionaire companies and hurts low to middle class Americans. You would never want your quality of life to deteriorate as much as it would if we allowed everyone who wants to come to this country to do so.

It's definitely not no matter how communicative they all are 33 fucking kids that's 33 doctors for each one in different fucking fields. I mean literally every aspect of it is insane.

A bunch of sick men who get off sexually to women's clothes are redefining and erasing women. Nothing left or progressive about this shit show.",1

"It's a bitter pill to swallow but what we ended up doing in WW2 was making East Europe and China safe for communism, and made the world safe for usurious banking dynasties to continue operating with impunity. And also the American inflected postwar order in Europe is what led to the multiculti madness there. One good thing about the communist countries, ironically, is that they were not under the thrall of this foreign imposed liberal order, so these countries today still remain homelands for their native population, with minimal demographic replacement (for now at least - the engineered migration crisis seeks to undo this).",1

Edit for your add on: I am a masculine lesbian and discussed just yesterday about how I am noticing fear from women when they see me in a bathroom. I am in my thirties and part of the LGB community for the better part of fifteen years.

Fucking disgusting how they preach tolerance and understanding and acceptance yet hate whites and anything good that they do. I'm willing to bet over 60% of them don't even listen to Trumps speeches because they don't want to hear what their president says. They just read what they want to hear from their biased sources and bitch and complain and slander anything the president does. Sickening. These people need some helicopter rides.,1

"We aren’t calling gay or trans people groomers and pedophiles, we’re calling groomer pedophile teachers who want to sexualise 5 year olds groomers and pedophiles. If that groomer pedophile happens to be gay or trans then there’s that, but it’s nothing to do with them as long as they aren’t the ones perverting children.",1
Lmao. But still at least this is a good female character that isn't a total Ma-Rey Sue feminist wank job. Probably because the source material is from Japan where they're not a bunch of total cuckolds quite yet.,1

"You’re female, no? Ftms almost always display a borderline offensively dumb-horny-bro schtick as a part of performing masculinity as it’s understood through female socialisation. Testosterone also interferes with healthy female sexuality and sends libido through the roof to bizarre levels.

That's one of minority aimed, government funded program I'd want my tax dollars to go towards.",1
"Trump is at the helm. What happens if he starts using these powers against his political opponents? We are in dangerous times. These agencies must be disbanded, not just staffed by pedes. We have a new election in 3 years, and Trump will be out in 7. What comes next? The Deep State fights dirty and there is no guarantee they will not place one of their own for 46. We stand on a precipice. We have a temporary repreive with Trump, but we still teeter on the edge of destruction.",1
"Ah yes, the left's opposition to an anti-grooming bill was totally about sexual identity... I'm glad you find yourself among the more rational people who say that raping children is wrong, but in a few years you'll also find yourself being called a bigot and a nazi for not accepting pedophiles.",1
The US has the ability to address both issues.. but chooses not to help in social issues.  far right politicians want to give that money back to the wealthy in tax cuts anyway.,1
"Season 3 was poorly received, featured a lot of bad episodes and a handful of decent ones, overall a big quality drop. Preceeding this was the revelation that they'd done a big diversity hire to fill up some ethnicity and sex quota instead of hiring based on writing talent.

"Back in the 90s we just kind of stopped giving a shit about the LGB, we were just like, yeah that's cool whatever, have at it.

But our Republican friends are wedded ideologically to the idea that government shouldn't take forceful action; that we should leave the welfare of the American people to the whims of the private sector.,1

And it does this all in the name of $1.4 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations.,1
"And to people saying that it should still be listed as a felony or misdemeanor because it was illegal at the time, it's kinda missing the point.

"DC and Marvel have been utter shit for years now, with all the retcons, pandering, forced diversity etc. &amp;#x200B; Image comics is where its at now but overall comics arent what they used to be.

"It's only guilt because whites won. Of course, liberals completely ignore black-on-black slavery, just like they ignore black-on-black violence that happens today.",1
Easy sell when you're such a rube that you think bringing race up at all is racism. Conservatives think we live in a post racial society and that colorblindness is the way to go. Literally anyone bringing up race is therefore a racist.,1

the Republican majority took the $12 billion in savings from the college student loan programmoney taken out of the programand instead of giving it back to the students to help them get through school. they put the money in a fund to help pay fortax cuts for the wealthiest people in America.

If you believe biological sex is real you are in fact transphobic. The fact you believe being transgender is an opinion shows what a transphobe you are,1
"When someone is critical of something you do, insult them and call them a racist. Sorry Dan, you're now the SJW you looked like.

"Do they mention the nudity? I bet they don’t mention the nudity. Or the age-range of the targeted audience (5+). It was a child safeguarding nightmare, literally strangers exposing their genitalia to children. So fuck the author claiming to be a victim when they’re actually a groomer.",1

"That shows why it's a perfect bit of rhetoric. It uses their favored techniques to reframe the argument in a way that traps them. They can’t argue against superstraight because it just as valid as any other made-up gender. Hence to fury and name-calling, which we can see in this very thread. It’s clearly hit a nerve. The fight against superphobia has a long way to go! I’ve just added superstraight and superphobia to my dictionary.",1
The other severe issue in California is “ballot harvesting” which the state legalized before the last election. It allows individuals to collect absentee ballots from others and return them. Massive potential for voter fraud.,1

If Trump hadn't won Kennedy would have likely had to retire during a Hillary presidency, or wait minimum 4 years, possibly 8 years, just to retire.

One day people might even talk about puppet masters who are using muslims as puppets to subvert countries. Who do you think is pushing multiculturalism and tolerance? Who is pushing anti-white and white guilt propaganda? Who is pushing hate-speech laws that censor and shut down valid conversation? Who owns the banks and politicians?

"The Lavon Affair was a failed covert Israeli op, which involved planting/detonating bombs in US-occupied buildings in Egypt. The idea was to blame the attacks on the Egyptians, so further British occupation of the country would be justified. It backfired though, and the Israeli agents were apprehended. Two of them committed suicide, while two others were tried and executed. In other words, this almost certainly mirrors many other recent COHENCIDENCES in global affairs.",1

"Hahaha what? What makes you think I automatically agree with anyone? I can think for myself and am openly skeptical of gender identity ideology, as much as I am of other new age pseudoscience.",1
"It has nothing to do with politics tho. Im a democrat. I think some of the more vocal SJWs are racist, misandrist and delusional.",1
"The poor Lion, Elephant, Rhino, etc. Dont deserve to die out because a bunch of dindus keeping multiplying and murdering them to sell their parts to asians",1
"Rural life is the inner death of a thousand cuts through a stifling set of unspoken rules and expectations- its a state of affairs that makes near everyone victims in thier own way, but it does mean the persecution complex about (((Coastal Elites))) gets tiresome.",1
"They don't have even close to the strongest bite force, friendo. My 'dindu dog' used to be known as the nanny breed and was trusted to care for children before it was hijacked by dindu culture",1
"Yeah one of the things that i fucking hate about obama was his regard for debt. It sets a terrible example and ends up enriching the globalists further. It should not become the norm to add 10 trillion to the debt every election. Itll make trump look bad, too. Im glad hes being proactive about stopping this shit.",1
"Pedos deserve death imo, but not at the expense of destroying religious liberties for christians while children are regularly raped and married off in Islam and no one gives a shit outside of the patriots who recognize Islam for the death cult it is.",1
they took all of that Social Security surplus. they put it all in the big government checkbook. they wrote out checks out of the big government checkbook.,1
"Very much so, I imagine. There is a trend that groomers are more likely to be Pakistani men than any other demographic, I'm not gonna lie.",1
"dysphoric autogynephiles and HSTS aren't more entitled than other mentally ill people. Treatment shouldn't come at the expense of an entire group. We don't imprison every person a schizophrenic patient believes is out to get them even if it would make them feel better. If smugness concerns you, you might want to have a word with r/truscum. [check this out](",1
the majority plans to use nearly $9 billion in cuts for the alleged deficit reduction. or to pay for their tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this Nation. They are going to take $9 billion out of the student loan account to pay for the tax cuts to the wealthiest 5 percent of the people in this country.,1
"You're right. White guys have done nothing good. Those evil white men just steal accomplishments from women and POC, we wuz kings n shit. I'm done arguing with a fucking cuck like you",1
Its really sad in society we cant question whether you’re straight or not with the issues with grooming and child safeguarding issues in the LGBT community. It will be like the Catholic Church or Rotterham where 20 years down the line loads of adults will come forward saying how deeply they were abused by people adorning the symbolism of the rainbow flag,1
"It has worked terribly either. It has most certainly influenced a lot of people. It is, however, just delaying the inevitable. More and more folks are coming around to Donald Trump. I see it in Canada, the UK and the US in real life when travelling for work. I am still yet to meet someone that supported trump and has changed their mind. I’ve seen many come onboard, anywhere from slightly pro trump to praise kek levels.",1
"After november 8th, we need to turn our attention to Soros and bring this Nazi piece of shit down. Hillary is just the start, Soros is the puppet master. If you want to kill the weed, you kill the roots. If we bring him and his organization down, the world not just the US will be better off. Drag this mother fucker out in the light and he will shrivel up in the sun like the worm he is.",1
You're just a fucking American man. People are mad at the mass immigration to America and Europe. So much mass immigration that they are literally displacing native populations.,1
I love when people create a new term to define their special snowflake selves and miss the point. 'vous' is french for 'you'. So... French isn't as triggering as English?,1
"Lol, or the notion that if you're a polite, respectful, decent human being who is remotely well socialized, you can in turn play well with other primates who are also remotely respectful and well socialized. It's like people don't get the most basic fundamentals of human and mammalian biology an social nature, but this is all a cover for my scientific racism/sexism. That's right - there are sex differences too!",1
"We would do well as a country to once again advocate the values of Judeo-Christianity, and the impact it had on our Declaration of Independence, and the God-given liberties we possess as codified by the Bill of Rights.",1
two months ago this same President also visited urban schools and stated that he wanted to offer a hand up.,1
"It will only apply to the indigenous population, not to the invaders. Hate crimes against whites are not hate crimes, because only whites can hate according to cultural Marxists. We see that in America all the time.",1
"Economists have never been ones to care about people's well being. If you weren't meant to be sacrificed to the *Economy God*, you would have been born into massive generational wealth so that you could achieve *job creator* status, the true calling of the human species.",1
He interviewed a cuck socialist Mayor who admitted that violence is concentrated in the migrant community but blamed it on poverty (even though the mayor simultaneously said that the State covers all of their basic needs such as food and housing).,1
"See, I never realized that bisexuals were grouped in with heteros. The transwoman who stalked me is bisexual and his personality fits more in line with narcissistic hetero AGPs than the homosexual group. This makes much more sense to me now.",1
"Holy shit, this explains their anger NPCs live their day *actually believing* that Donald Trump is about to be impeached. It's not a line, it's not a troll, they *actually believe it*. And then they wake up the next day and it still hasn't happened. My God, they've been expecting this for like two years now. They must have balls bluer than the fucking Challenger Deep.",1
Let us look at the facts. The bipartisan welfare reforms of 1996 have cut the welfare rolls by more than 50 percent. We have succeeded in breaking the welfare web.,1

Let’s start with the fact that damn near all these mass shooters were on psychotropic drugs and in a fatherless home.,1
"My one buddy is Colombian. He said the niggers down there are ruthless, worse then the ones from America. He's a white Colombian he said the joggers constantly do crazy ass shit down there.",1
"They can't handle the cognitive dissonance. Especially TIMs. In my experience, any time I've shared my thoroughly-considered and carefully phrased thoughts in good faith, they've never managed to avoid just going straight for ad hominems. Because they don't know what to say. After all, it's much easier to tell us that we're wrong because we're tErFs than it is to actually form a coherent argument.",1
"The Democrats are the reasonable, sensible, business-as-usual alternative to the Republicans' moustache twirling villainy. But that's the point. You either have the choice between carrying on like usual, which has been screwing over the working class for decades, or picking the party which will allow you to vent all that built up frustration on people who have done nothing to deserve it: LGBTQ, anyone not white, etc...",1
"Ah yes, autogynephiles are particularly well known for caring for their children. Wives of AGPs are often known to complain about how bored they are because their spouses just won't stop doing all the housework and childcare!",1
"Because AGP means you try to become what you want to have sex with, and most of these dudes want to have sex with teenage girls.",1
Those Pedes that are affected are more than welcome in Texas. Too many liberals are moving here and we need more Pedes to even it out! Lower taxes too!,1
"The whole 'Obama creates a random executive order but now you can't undo it because it'll hurt feefees' bullshit that the random activist judge did is the most bullshit ever. Executive orders are easily overturned, which is why they're risky and not laws. DACA should be dead already!",1
"He was a good boy and loved his golden retriever. Always turned his homework in on time. Shits getting old man, these people are killers and don’t need to be sympathized.",1
and I will bet on 500 occasions I have criticized the other party for being irresponsible in the treatment of taxpayer funds and in the failure of the Democratic Party to balance the budget.,1
"&gt; Luckily, an earth with increasing extreme weather everywhere There is no scientific evidence that weather will get worse in a warmer world. That is just ascientific alarmist speculation.",1
"We’re about to head into the dumbest fascist regime imaginable, where they pretend to be a democracy by simply saying, “No reasonable person would think our jack-booted thugs murdering minorities isn’t just a form of satire,” or something insane like that.",1
"Remember, CA used to be Republican, until an activist judge said it was unconstitutional that voters passed a proposition to exclude illegal immigrants from welfare.",1
The proof is already there--biological sex is real and gender identity conforms to biological sex 99% of the time across all species.,1
"You can literally figure out her position in advance by listening to Trump, then figure out “Opposite Day”. She has no principles or standards, she just doesn’t like Trump. Next April fools he she announce a huge policy shift to free gibsmedat hardcore communism, then watch her go classical liberal like Thomas Jefferson.",1
CRT is law school and graduate level work and has never been taught in grade schools or high schools. The GOP and racist have used it to divide people and believe in something that isn’t happening. It’s a made up issue to prevent teaching basic history because real history has parts where white people are not the good people in the narrative.,1
"They will take delight in watching you suffer, but as soon as the tables turn against them the ugly beta will rear it's head.",1
He broke rule 1. Around 13/52 you never relax. It cost him his life you all better remember this even in old age it will save you.,1
"I think a lot of us are contemplating gun ownership. I never owned a gun and never had much interest. That is changing as I see just how insane the left is becoming. Between BLM terrorists (purchased by the left), Islamic terrorists (allowed in the country by the left), and just your radical SJW (encouraged by the left), times seem more dangerous than ever.",1
We all know this administrations performance on job growth: since President Bush assumed office. he has pushed for three separate tax cuts for the wealthy. yet he has not created a single net job.,1
"By removing Christianity or muddying the social waters enough with confusion, this is the only way they can seize power and hijack the government usually for the purpose of installing a communistic/socialistic government. A moral and intelligent citizenry is the biggest safeguard to the republic that we have. A lot of Obama's actions seem to come straight out of the atheist/secularist/socialist playbook really.",1
"I dont mean to offender any fellow pedes but I really dont think its us doing most of the redpilling. the left does it all on their own with their draconian rules and fascist limiting of free speech. being attacked for wanting to have a traditional family, life, gender, and rights makes anyone with common sense start to doubt what they are being told.",1
"Work in tv, can confirm. A lot of union people are based - grips and electrics, even camera and audio. Art - not so much, in my experience anyway.",1
but I respectfully submit to the Senator from Michigan that we had better not overlook the fact that. through the failure to enforce law and order. through statements made by civic and religious leaders that civil disobedience.,1
Is there any hope of a Republican ever winning mayor there again? Sounds like that's what it will take so NYC doesn't turn into Baltimore or Chicago,1
After a number of awards were given to mtfs the SOLE natal womens category of the night came up and boy was it a shit show.,1
"Austria, its time for the next plan of action: removing kebab. I'm sure you will make the right choice, you've been on a good track so far. After that, alliance with neighboring Hungary and nearby Poland would be nice. Maybe Denmark and the Czech Republic too, I've heard they're doing well. Denmark's still at step 1, but it's much better than step -1000 like U.K. or France, or step nuke-this-damn-place-now like Sweden.",1
"Unemployment is pretty low these days... And take a look at the shithole cities and tell me: What party ran those cities, practically unopposed, into the ground? Also, I'd rather live in Detroit than Haiti anyday. American shithole is a nice clean working toilet compared to the world's shitholes.",1
autogynephilia is when a male is sexually aroused by the thought of himself as a female. it’s a motivating factor for a lot of people who transition from male to female (a lot of trans “lesbians” specifically),1
"UGH OPPRESHUN SO TRIGGERED But nope, you never hear about that. It’s only a problem when lesbians are looking for biological women. Go figure. 🙄",1
It's almost as if Eastern Europeans and Ethnic Russians had reasons why they Shoah'd the jews when the Wehrmacht had the USSR occupied.,1
It shows that not only is the increasing disparity in number in the public schools between nonwhite and white children the result of a vast immigration of colored and Puerto Rican people.,1
"Seriously? Lol, you're joking right? You... you really think they stay out of US politics with all of those dual citizen people in congress?",1

"Yeah your conservatives are living in a fantasy land with a 1996 mindset where they think they can regulate the flow of information. Just focus on removing kebabs and stop worrying about dummies jacking off to fisting porn, Theresa.",1
"And much of that was done by right wingers trying to make the left wing groups look bad. For example, the police station that was shot at and set on fire? That was a Boogaloo Boi. He confessed.",1
"Why would you choose to use that word? Are you not aware that nazis use it express solidarity with each other? I'm Jewish and no one I know utters that word. I have only ever understood it to be a derogatory way to refer to non-Jews. You're also perpetuating the falsehood that all Jews are Zionists, and all non-Jews are not, when in reality the vast majority of Zionists are not Jewish.",1
America shouldn't have senators that are dual citizens. I have nothing against Jews or Israel but I don't feel comfortable having an Israeli as a senator especially knowing congress is responsible for billions of $ that goes to Israel. Fine with sending that money but I want Americans making the decision.,1
and you must obey the law. The mandatory entitlement programs continue to increase at an outofcontrol rate. This bills mandatory spending continues to gobble up more of the discretionary programs.,1
"To be *entirely* charitable, they might be reacting to the sexist expectation that women should shave their bodies, and to a culture that sexualises teenage girls and pushes them to objectify themselves. But it's still fucking creepy to obsess over your kids' junk. Plus, as people have already pointed out in this thread, GC loses all right to complain about beauty standards surrounding women's body hair when they themselves turn around and mock trans women for being hairy.",1
"Jfl at this vote brigade. To any soybois reading this, women will not fuck you in gratitude for downvoting us.",1
"Epstein is no small fish. He is too well connected to be Arkacided. His handler is Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of a Mossad agent (I believe Robert Maxwell). His ties with Rachel Chandler will be where things really get ugly. She is straight up Rothschild family. Look for this one to blow up.",1
"*“For more than 40 years, big business and the Republican party have teamed up to drive down the wages of construction workers by attacking their unions, passing so-called “right-to-work laws”, and weakening or repealing prevailing wage laws— which protect construction wages from downward pressure. They have, unfortunately, been very successful. Construction wages are lower today than they were in 1970, despite 40 years of economic growth and a higher national income.”*",1
"I think that is the heart of the alt movement on the left, right, and center. No more globalism. No more lies about multiculturalism. No more suppression of rational HBD. It is about truth, unity, taking back our country, and bringing back our jobs.",1
"And to top of the shit sundae, the worlds most stereotypical stronk empowered black womyn with an afro larger than fucking Sazh's.",1
After a point stealing everything or relying on handouts should make anyone realize you just can't move within society without being a good faith member of it.,1
While i’m not against this its still hard for the mexican government to stop every illegal immigrant from crossing here its impossible to control every citizen. I think it would be better for us to just make very secure borders and request mexico pay for some of it and if they refuse then we can lay the tariffs,1
**TL;DR** - GG was based on fundamentally valid concerns and was a backlash against clear wrongdoing by an increasingly atomizing and exploitative industry by a group of people who were deeply engaged in a set of cultural norms and values… but they all turned evil because I say so also fuck white people.,1
"Honestly, I'm so done at this point. Trans activists are trying to justify violence against women and tried to have the video removed. Did you see the other video from a different angle? I hope this is being investigated.",1
And they will say that those of us that want to secure our borders and reestablish the rule of law and end automatic citizenship for babies that happen to be born to illegal mothers on U.S. soil.,1
"I never liked him, even when he was on our side. Just felt fake to me. And I've got a reasonably good detector for this. (I also think Sessions is our guy, so take that for what it's worth. I think him and Trump are working behind the scenes together on a lot more shit than anyone realizes, but making it public right now would be horrible prosecutorial strategy.)",1
Yet Mr. Gompers and other labor leaders come here and on the Capitol steps of this Nation attack prohibition and say that in doing so they are speaking for the working classes of the country.,1
"i'd call him a soyboi basically all of his opinions are flavored more by his emotions rather than logic. he wants all of the globalist socialist crap and knows it doesn't work, but still sits on that side and advocates for it anyways hates trump because it feels right to him, trump's words hurt his feelings",1

I was Governor of my State before I came to the Senate 22 years ago. No one worked harder to clear up the social welfare rolls than I did. I had the director of public welfare in my office every other day to make sure that every father was made responsible for supporting his children.,1
Wage gap is dumb and hurts my head when I hear it. It’s not real based off an average but feminists clung to it for their victim boo hoo cry about things that aren’t even real so they can keep a semblance of “patriarchy”,1
"Thanks to Obunga, it is considered offensive to be proud of your heritage as a white person, and it is offensive to be proud of your country. And if you claim discrimination, hordes of angry SJWs pounce on you like buzzards. The media has brainwashed people to bend over backwards for all flavors of minorities, whether they are criminals or not, but OMFG the backlash if you dare say that law abiding white people are disadvantaged in any way or being discriminated against.",1

Sympathy is between shit and syphilis in the dictionary. The english dictionary. And five kids? End birthright citizenship now!,1

You are doing exactly what the left wants and why they are using Greta, you are doing their bidding by attacking a child INSTEAD of being outraged against the adults being funded by Soros to use Greta for their purposes. Maybe you could try with a serious response, if you expect to be taken seriously.",1
"Are you pretending to be retarded or is your reading comprehension just shit? Or are you a literal Khazar arguing in bad faith? I didn’t say your people killed Christ. A modern Neo Nazi didn’t participate in the Holocaust but they likely supported it right? Oh but none of them had grandparents in the Third Reich so they can’t be anti-Semitic, right?",1
"Then I tell them that no adult exists who has never referenced race, and they're holding Trump to an impossible standard which none of the other candidates meet (you don't know what it's like to be poor, superpredators need to be brought to heel).",1
those FUCKERS have a trucking child groomer power mod in their fucking social circle but jerked each other off about how AWFUL some of us kia *gamers* were for getting pissed off about loli and tiddy games getting banned and censored.

"Elite Luciferian globalists need stem cells to stay alive, how else does Soros continue to evade death?",1
You give employers incentives to bring jobs into the economy. This tax cut is going to result in exactly that kind of job creation in our country.

"If you are a pre-op transwoman representing yourself as a biological female to convince a straight man or a lesbian to sleep with you, you're a liar, and a manipulator, and willfully tricking people into sex when you know they likely would not consent if they had all the facts, which puts you on the level of the most underhanded sorts of pickup artists.",1

"Most of the dialog has subtle things sprinkled throughout, such as Dutch trying to hold morale high ground on Bill Williamson because Bill fought in the American Indian Wars - apparently making him an evil man. There is also a stranger that stands on the sidewalk trying to sell pamphlets about white power (or something to that degree) and if you murder him, you get positive honor, meaning they are insinuating it is honorable to murder racists.

" It is hard to believe that Senate Democrats now agree their own recent votes on border security were actually immoral, that it would be better to keep the government shut down than to invest one one-thousand of Federal spending in fencing that the Obama administration bragged about building.   It is particularly hard for me to believe that my distinguished colleagues from Maryland and Virginia, who are understandably very concerned with the circumstances of the Federal workforce, would rather echo Speaker Pelosi's fringe position--rather echo Speaker Pelosi's fringe position--than work with the White House to find a real compromise and reopen the government.

"The term should make it clear that they are not the same as biological women. I understand that that may be hard for those with dysphoria and personally I don't mind casually using pronouns etc out of courtesy.

"Yep, mass deporting all of leeches and illegals lets us keep a pretty penny too all things considered.",1
"Open physical conflict is something we need to avoid at all costs. On every level. We can win the cultural battle. I argue we already are. If we simply move some of these leftists to a centrist position, we win. If we flip Gen Z so they are rebelling against their ridiculous lefty parents we win. If we get good family values and hard work front and center as an American value, we definitely win.",1

This latter program requires meticulous staff administration in inspecting older homes and in counseling lower income families seeking homeownership. This was not done in the Detroit FHA office. The problem was not the design of the basic law but the administration of the law.,1

"I understand what you're saying, but they're just going to ban the sub and the zip of anyone who starts it. It's not really a viable tactic. Furthermore, nobody will know about them, so they'll just b tiny subs waiting for the rate of the fucking cucks admins. We need a real plan. Reddit wants to rid themselves of us yesterday.

At this point I'm not sure who is more dangerous. Radical Islamic terrorists or the liberal Americans protecting them. We can't even have a discussion about Islam without liberals calling people some kind of phobe or ist. Liberals have weaponized the English language and wield that weapon against anyone who stands up to terrorism. Liberals are protecting foreign invaders who kill American citizens. Back in my day we called people that did that traitors.,1
At least in the article the writer calls the illegal scum out for what he is. An illegal criminal alien. This article is an example of real news unlike CNN fake news,1

A big problem here is the conservatism comes with a big dose of open borders. The big money agriculture in the middle of the state loves their cheap labor.

When we get literally censored... In the past we laid on the ground and took it. #THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. THE FIGHT STARTS HERE",1
The mentality to stand up for themselves as Americans has been beaten out of them in the public school system. Patriotism is all but vilified since day one.,1

As we consider this bill. we are in the midst of a war with a vicious enemya war on terrorism that must be won. Our troops are also engaged in a bloody effort to stabilize Iraq.,1
"I liked Shauns take (on I believe his Charlottesville vid). He quoted a poll that said 9% of Americans were sympathetic to or held white nationalist beliefs. Well even if it that poll was wildly off and it was only 1% (when probably the reverse was true, probably more people hold those beliefs then would admit in a poll), that’s still 3,000,000 hardcore nazis, and they don’t all have 1488 tatted on their foreheads.",1

" Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. President, yesterday, the Provide Accurate Information Directly, PAID Act took a pivotal step closer to becoming law. Once enacted, this vital legislation, which I had the privilege of coauthoring with Senator Cardin, will save tens of millions of taxpayer dollars through targeted and commonsense updates to the Medicare secondary payer, MSP, statute, which Congress first codified four decades ago. The PAID Act aims to ensure that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CMS, in coordinating claims related to Medicare Advantage MA, or Medicare Part D plans, can provide the information needed for settling parties to resolve claims-fairly and efficiently. In short, this bill is a boon for seniors, Main Street job creators, and the American taxpayer. As this bill approaches the legislative finish line, I would like to thank Chairman Grassley for his invaluable support in working with my office, as well as with our Democratic counterparts and with CMS, to bolster, refine, and identify legislative avenues for our proposal. I would also like to thank Senator Cardin for his partnership in co-leading this legislation, along with Representatives Kind and Bilirakis, who introduced a companion bill in the House, which passed by voice vote yesterday. Together, I feel confident that we can see the PAID Act signed into law by the end of the year. Congress amended the MSP statute in 2007 to require parties to a dispute--known as primary plans--to report settlements, judgments, and awards to Medicare through so-called section 111 reports. This amendment allowed Medicare to-seek recovery from settling parties when Medicare paid for healthcare because other payment was not available or reasonably expected to be available. While this system has functioned well for the Medicare Fee-for-Service program, where CMS has the claims data needed for recovery, it has not worked successfully for the MA Part C and Part D programs, where CMS does not have the requisite Part C and Part D claims data and cannot recover for payments that have been made. To compound the problem, settling parties are often unable to identify the correct Part C or Part D plan to be able to coordinate benefits, should they choose to do so. This legislation closes that critical information by having CMS communicate the Part C and Part D plan identification to settling parties in response to a section 111 report. CMS has that data and can provide it. Congress recognizes that for the last 8 years, CMS has provided section 111 reports to the Part C and Part D Plans, and Congress expects that CMS will continue to do so after this legislation is enacted. Further, the existing MSP statute and regulations impose specific requirements on CMS, and on Part C and Part D plans, to pay for claims in some situations, to not pay for claims in other situations, and to pursue recovery of claims when appropriate. Nothing in this legislation is intended to change any of those obligations or requirements, and Congress expects Part C and Part D plans to continue to seek recovery of claims by timely notifying settling parties when a payment has been made that should be reimbursed, consistent with the CMS notice procedures. This legislation is only intended to provide more information to the settling parties so that they have the ability to coordinate with Part C and Part D plans earlier, if they so choose. Congress has afforded CMS 12 months to implement this law, and we urge the agency to move with all deliberate speed to both implement its own system changes and coordinate with primary plans throughout the implementation process. Regular communication and coordination will prove critical in ensuring that Primary Plans are aware of the data exchange requirements that CMS plans to implement and are prepared as quickly as possible to utilize the data CMS will be providing under this law. By involving all stakeholders throughout the implementation process, CMS can implement our intent that the needed plan identity information be available for parties to coordinate benefits as efficiently as possible.",1

"Don't forget most Germans were nazis. Also those 70m people voted for the guy who called for a complete shutdown on Muslims entering america. If I changed that religion to another one I don't think people would be questioning if they are nazis. Further they use talking points like cultural marxism which is just a rebranding of cultural bolshevism, a term made by the nazi party that is heavily steeped in their worst thoughts.",1
If Rosenrat leaves then Sessions is also leaving. Those were Sessions own fucking words. Sessions is not /our guy/ and he is not fucking sleeping. He’s a compromised deep state agent working as the last barrier to hold the swamp from ever seeing the inside of a fucking prison.,1
"And it isn’t even all murder by gun they care about. They don’t seem to care about suicides or murder by gangs, drug cartels, inner city crime, etc. Only when there are white people involved and more than one person was killed at the same time.",1

I stopped caring about being called racist years ago and I have been bitched at quite a bit on this sub for it. Too many cuckservatives who love to be replaced *legally*...,1
I started out helping to post to taxwins. It seems several pedes had similar ideas about not letting the good news get memory holed! This one though is all types of maga..,1
wrong for us to do this war funding without paying for it. wrong to give out tax cuts to wealthy people when we were in a deficit. I thought we owed it to our children and grandchildren to pay for our bills today.,1

"Because the only chains, and they're very light chains made of velvet, upon their behaviour are government regulations which require tax funds for violations to be investigated and punishment applied.

"The West needs more of that. When those people post here, though, they need to abide by this sub's culture- the nationalism here is softer and more 'moderate', which is partly a by-product of its unofficial connection to a major political campaign.

I haven't stepped a foot in a Target store since they announced the policy allowing biological men into women's restrooms and dressing rooms. It's been over two years now and I don't miss Target.,1
"I don't think he's self hating. He's creating chaos in the world, that's what globalists like him need. While we bicker amongst ourselves with these manufactured conflicts and problems, we have no time to divert our attention to people like him. The foreign coups, wars, race tensions, migrant crisis, all created by people like him. Look how preoccupied the world is with these things instead of catching and hanging the perpetrators, the true cause of evil in this world.",1
we have turned a once proud. mighty U.S. merchant marine into the welfare queens of the high seas. They are quick to point to farm subsidles.,1
Colorblindness is liberal bullshit intended to dismiss discussions of race relations because they make white people uncomfortable. Black people don't get to be colorblind. Not giving a shit about what race someone is in a personal context is not colorblindness if that's what you mean.,1

Younger conservatives have been exposed to nothing but big government cuckservatives they don’t even know they’re supposed to fight for a small government. Trump is teaching them how to win. A small government is the goal.,1
"Oh cool, then he can start in Chicago and convince all the fine folks on the south and west side to hand them over.",1
His anti-colonialism attitude is fueled by the unfulfilled dreams of his absentee father. He rages against American success in order to satisfy a deep emptiness. He's become the African warlord sitting in a gilded palace while the ones he claims to succor suffer horribly. Ask Indonesia why they tore down his statue.,1

That is the legislation that was originally contained in H.R. 530. the Criminal Welfare Prevention Act. Part II.,1
You know why that narrative is pushed so hard? Most SJW consider getting off the couch to be cardio. I want to see these women fighting for biological men to compete against biological women to step into a boxing ring with a biological man. I'm sure a few months of hormone therapy and some lipstick will stop her head from being caved in.,1
The downfall of Britain can be directly linked to the Rothschild involvement during the battle of Waterloo.,1
"Their ideas/points are not as threatening to the globalist cultural Marxist plot, obviously. They are not as far off the reservation of acceptable thought. Big big difference between Molyneux and Peterson for instance, though they agree on enough to have a good convo. Peterson is a milquetoast classical liberal, Stef talks about race realism and the federal reserve.",1
"I feel like they're gaining ground and I'm powerless to stop them. I need advice on how to stop SJW feminists from taking over a group I'm in.

They also love calling trans people?predators and groomers because who wouldnt be against pedophilia?!,1
"Mass shootings are predominately white but murders are overwhelmingly committed by black people in America. 13% of the population committing over half of all murders annually, mostly black on black crime.

"Amiri King is a lame ass fuckboy who built his entire career by stealing jokes and saying crass edgy shit on Facebook and Twitter.

"How is there any justification for leaving deceased persons on the rolls?? That is not voter suppression, it is election integrity.

"I mean, I'm glad that she isn't apologising for her stance, but her logic doesn't seem consistent to me. What possible contribution can transwomen make to feminism if we are working from the position that they are neither biologically female nor experience female socialisation?",1

"This is a new development and I would say it's also questionable development. I wager that this development opens the door for AGPs to claim to be Muxe.

"I always saw (or since I discovered radfem) bimbofication as TIMs becoming what they think women should be.

The banking Cabal is running the entire operation. Always follow the money. The families behind the banks are the true enemy. Israel is dealt with last because the Rothchilds are at the heart of the entire conspiracy. Corsi is a huge defender of Israel. It's not going to end well for him.

"Race realism isn't about one race being superior, it's about recognizing the differences in blacks/whites/asians/latinos and acting accordingly.

"As long as all money is issued and controlled by the bourgeoisie, “number go up” will always be the goal. Making the proletariat’s meager wealth even more meager is the absolute most powerful tool of economic oppression.

If Marx and Engels were alive now, the Manifesto wouldn’t have focused on the means of production, but the means of exchange.",1
"President Trump actually cares about Americans being successful, unlike gum-chewing Nervous Wreck Nancy Pelosi, who would much rather every American submit to government handouts while struggling to find work.
